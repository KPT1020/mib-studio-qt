## Vendored / checked-in

- **Euresys EGrabber SDK** — `egrabber-sample-programs/` (reference source
  tree); actual SDK is assumed installed system-side. See
  `docs/integration/egrabber.md`.
- **Coremor XMT DLL** — `include/Coremor/` (`.h`, `.lib`, `.dll`). Used by
  [[../services/AutofocusService]].

## How they're wired

- `CMakeLists.txt` calls `find_package(Qt6 ...)` and so on; Conan
  generates the toolchain (`build/conan_toolchain.cmake`).
- Qt shared DLLs + plugins are deployed next to the exe via
  `windeployqt.exe` in a post-build step.
- OpenCV and HDF5 DLLs are also copied next to the exe (see
  `docs/howto/windows-deploy.md`).
- Windows-only hardware SDK linkage is gated by `MIB_HAS_EGRABBER`
  (`WIN32` => `ON`, otherwise `OFF`):
  - EGrabber headers/system path are only added when `MIB_HAS_EGRABBER=1`.
  - Coremor include/lib wiring is only added when `MIB_HAS_EGRABBER=1`.
