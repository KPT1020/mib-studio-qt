# Dependencies

> Third-party stack. Managed by Conan (`conanfile.txt`).

| Package | Version | Shared? | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| qt | 6.7.3 | ✓ | Widgets + Charts + SerialPort + ImageFormats |
| spdlog | 1.17.0 | | Logging ([[../conventions/Logging]]) |
| sqlite3 | 3.51.0 | | [[../services/SqliteService]] |
| hdf5 | 1.14.6 | ✓ | C++ API enabled — [[../services/Hdf5Service]] |
| opencv | 4.12.0 | ✓ | dnn=False, openexr=False. Linked modules: `core`, `imgproc`, `imgcodecs`, `videoio` (AVI read/write by [[../data-model/FrameStore]] and [[../services/BatchMaskSources]]) — [[../services/ProcessingService]] |
| onnxruntime | 1.18.1 | | Optional in Linux cloud builds; when unavailable the build uses `YoloService.stub.cpp` and disables YOLO runtime features while keeping the rest of the app buildable — [[../services/YoloService]] |
| nlohmann_json | 3.11.3 | | Config parsing / serialization |

## Vendored / checked-in

- **Euresys EGrabber SDK** — `egrabber-sample-programs/` (reference source
  tree); actual SDK is assumed installed system-side. See
  `docs/integration/egrabber.md`.
- **Coremor XMT DLL** — `include/Coremor/` (`.h`, `.lib`, `.dll`). Used by
  [[../services/AutofocusService]].

## How they're wired

- `CMakeLists.txt` calls `find_package(Qt6 ...)` and so on; Conan
  generates the toolchain (`build/conan_toolchain.cmake`).
- Qt shared DLLs + plugins are deployed next to the exe via
  `windeployqt.exe` in a post-build step.
- OpenCV and HDF5 DLLs are also copied next to the exe (see
  `docs/howto/windows-deploy.md`).
- Windows-only hardware SDK linkage is gated by `MIB_HAS_EGRABBER`
  (`WIN32` => `ON`, otherwise `OFF`):
  - EGrabber headers/system path are only added when `MIB_HAS_EGRABBER=1`.
  - Coremor include/lib wiring is only added when `MIB_HAS_EGRABBER=1`.

## Linux cloud build notes

- If CMake fails before project checks with
  `/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lstdc++`, verify which compiler `/usr/bin/c++`
  resolves to. Some images pin `c++` to a clang alternative while missing the
  matching unversioned `libstdc++.so` path for that toolchain.
- In those environments, switching `c++` to `g++` resolves the runtime linker
  path issue:
  - `sudo update-alternatives --set c++ /usr/bin/g++`
