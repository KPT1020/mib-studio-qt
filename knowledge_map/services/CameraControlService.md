# CameraControlService

> Device discovery and one-shot parameter application. Does **not** own the
> acquisition thread — that's [[CaptureService]].

## Responsibility

- `discoverCameras()` / `discoverFramegrabbers()` — enumerate Euresys
  interfaces, devices, and streams. Returns `DiscoveredCamera` /
  `DiscoveredFramegrabber` with index triples and human labels.
- `applyScriptToDevice(ifIdx, devIdx, scriptPath, errorOut)` — push a
  GenICam JS file to a specific device.
- `deviceReset(ifIdx, devIdx, errorOut)` — issue SFNC `DeviceReset`;
  best-effort stops acquisition first.

## Threading

Synchronous, called from main thread.

## Platform behavior

- **Windows (`MIB_HAS_EGRABBER=1`)**: full EGrabber-backed discovery, script
  apply, and device reset.
- **Non-Windows (`MIB_HAS_EGRABBER=0`)**: methods compile as safe fallbacks:
  discovery returns empty vectors; mutating operations return `false` and can
  populate `errorOut`.

## Gotchas

- Applying a script **stops capture** as a side effect (done in
  [[../architecture/AppBackend]]). Capture does not auto-restart.
- Mock cameras are not discovered here — they're configured via
  `AppBackend::configureMockCamera`.
- See `docs/howto/external-config-and-camera-script.md` for script format
  and `docs/integration/egrabber.md` for SDK notes.
